Moderate pricing (₹300–₹700 for two) attracts maximum ratings.

Locations with high restaurant density show more competition but also better customer choices.

📈 Visualizations

✔️ Bar Charts & Pie Charts – Cuisine distribution, cost categories
✔️ Heatmaps – Correlation between votes, cost, and ratings
